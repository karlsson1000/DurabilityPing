# Durability Ping

Durability Ping is a lightweight Fabric client-side mod that helps you avoid breaking your tools, weapons, and armor by warning you when their durability is low.

When an item is about to break at ~10% durability left, you’ll receive:
- **A red warning message**
- **A short sound notification**

### Example:

## Features
- Monitors durability of:
  - Main hand & off hand items
  - Helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots
- Warns only once per item until it’s repaired or replaced.
- Default warn threshold: ~10% durability left, takes Unbreaking enchantments into account.
