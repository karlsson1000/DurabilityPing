# Durability Ping

Durability Ping is a lightweight Fabric client-side mod that helps you avoid breaking your tools, weapons, and armor by warning you when their durability is low.

When an item is about to break (default ~10% durability, or your configured threshold), you’ll receive:
- **A red warning message**
- **A short sound notification**

### Example:

## Features
- Monitors durability of:
  - Main hand & off hand items
  - Helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots
- Warns only once per item until it’s repaired or replaced.
- Default warn threshold: ~10% durability left, takes Unbreaking enchantments into account.

## Configuration
- Adjustable warning threshold (default 10%)
- Enable/disable warning sound (default on)
- For in-game configuration via a GUI, [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) is required
